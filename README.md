### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒ± I am Binqing Wu, a Ph.D. student at Zhejiang University, under the supervision of Prof. [Ling Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=Vxi9eakAAAAJ).

ðŸ˜„ I am interested in multi-variate time series forecasting, including
- traffic forecasting: [DSTCGCN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00518), [TrendGCN (CIKM 2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03063)
- weather forecasting: [WeatherGNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05517)
- air quality forecasting: [GAGNN (TKDD)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12238)
- general multi-variate time series forecasting: [MAGNN (TKDE)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.04828)

ðŸ”­ I am currently working on post-processing numerical weather prediction and precipitation nowcasting.
